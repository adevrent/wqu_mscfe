    "> c. Set the absolute values of all the roots of $B >1$, then convert all the inequalities in terms of $\\alpha$ and $\\theta$ coefficients. Now we have a set of inequalities to regulate $\\alpha$ and $\\theta$ coefficients <br>\n",
    "> d. With these regularity conditions on $\\alpha$ and $\\theta$ coefficients, we can ensure that an ARMA($p,q$) time series $X_{t}$ can only be expressed as a function of its past values and not its future values. This property is called **causality**. The regularity conditions also ensure that $\\{W_{t}\\}$ from ARMA($p,q$) can be expressed as an infinite AR process. This property is called **invertibility**. <br>\n",

    "ARIMA Model stands for autoregressive integrated moving average model. Why do we add \"integrated\" into the name of the ARIMA model? \"Integrated\" in the ARIMA model means to include the differencing method to remove trend or seasonality in a time series. We learned from the last section that an ARMA model only handles stationary time series. It is different for an ARIMA model. An ARIMA model can handle non-stationary time series. \n",
