    "The first unit root test we'll discuss is the Dickey Fuller test. <u> The Dickey Fuller test determines if unit roots exist in a time series. </u> The Dickey Fuller test is the base of the augmented Dickey Fuller test, which we will discuss in the next section. The Dickey Fuller test can be described as follows.\n",

    "For the following AR(1) process:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x_t = \\alpha x_{t-1} + \\varepsilon_t $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\varepsilon_t$ is white noise\n",
    "\n",
    "By doing the following manipulation, we can rewrite the above equation as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\begin{align*}\n",
    "  x_t - x_{t-1} &= \\alpha x_{t-1} - x_{t-1} + \\varepsilon_t  \\\\\n",

    "The above Dickey Fuller test is equivalent to test if $\\alpha=1$. However, under $H_0$, the time series is not stationary and the usual normal distribution tests do not apply. The test statistic we will use is known as a unit root test statistic or Dickey Fuller (DF) statistic. When you run a Dickey Fuller test with statistical software, it will usually provide you with the critical test values at 1%, 5%, and 10% levels. If you set the significance level at 5% and the DF statistic > 5% critical value, you fail to reject $H_0$. This means there is a unit root for $x_t$. We will talk more about this when we demonstrate the test with an example. \n",

    "We just discussed this version of the test above. Under $H_0$, this test is also used to test if the process is random walk. We label this test as $\\tau_1$ following Dickey and Fuller's article (Dickey and Fuller, 1979). Since there will be more versions of the Dickey Fuller test introduced in this section, it is easier to reference different versions of the test with their labels. The statistical software we will use later to demonstrate our example will also use the same labeling system for different versions of Dickey Fuller test.\n",

For example, $\\tau_1$, $\\tau_2$, and $\\tau_3$ test for the presence of a unit root. $\\phi_1$ and $\\phi_3$ are to test for the presence of a unit root and the absence of a constant. $\\phi_2$ is to test the presence of unit roots and the absence of constants and time trends. If we are not sure about the model specifications, we would usually run all of them and compare the test results. \n"
